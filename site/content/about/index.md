## Garance / Flore

While I like my first given name very much, it has proven very impractical where I live, in Spain. For this reason, you can call me Flore! It's my second given name, and is almost as cool.

Garance is a reference to the heroin of [the movie Children of Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Paradise), played by [french actress Arletty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arletty).

## Education

It took me a while to know programming was my calling. After a literature-focused highschool diploma, I switched to a statistics / psychology double bachelor in Lyon, France. At the end of those 3 years, where I followed several introductory classes to algorithmic, my mind was made up! I moved to Antibes, in the beautiful French Riviera, to follow a 3 years school in computer science.

I graduated from the French engineering school Polytech Nice Sophia in 2016, and I've been living and working in Barcelona ever since.

## Work

I am curently working at [Marfeel](https://marfeel.com), where we build a mobile website template, to optimise user experience. I'm having a tremendous good time there, being surrounded by nice AND smart people.
