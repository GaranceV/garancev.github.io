In 2019, inspired by many others, I decided to try out public speaking. 
Since then, I've had the opportunity to speak on various stages, and to meet incredible peers!

In 2023, I've started to shift my focus, from public speaking myself to coaching peers to get into public speaking. 
I don't advocate for everyone being a public speaker forever, but I do believe everyone should try it out, see if they enjoy it or not.
