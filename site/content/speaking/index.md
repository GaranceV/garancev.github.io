In 2019, inspired by many others, I decided to try out public speaking.
One year later, I have a few engagements, and am excited to see what's next!

## 2020, 2021

Unfortunately, everything scheduled early 2020 got cancelled... You know why! ðŸ˜·

I had scheduled to speak at different events, with a new talk focused on Git.
Hit me up if you want to hear it!
